# 🤖 TIAGo Robot Simulation

This project simulates the TIAGo mobile robot in a kitchen environment using Webots and Python.

## 📽️ Demonstration
Below are two videos demonstrating the robot's capabilities:

### Video 1: Mapping, Navigation, and Path Planning

The robot follows a predefined trajectory to explore and build a map of the environment. Then, it performs path planing and navigation based on the constructed map.

### Video 2: Pick-and-Place Task Execution

The goal is that the robot can autonomously detect, grasp, and transfer three jars from a worktop surface to a designated position on a nearby table.

The solution is designed such that the robot mimics how a human would perform the task. The behavior is structured using a behavior tree and involves the following steps:
1. Move to the worktop
2. Detect the presence of target jars
3. Select and pick one of the detected jars
4. Transfer it to the designated position on the table
5. Repeat until the task is complete

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bibi-VN/tiago_simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory 
   ```bash
   cd ~/tiago_simulation
   ```
3. Create and activate the Conda environment:  
   This project uses [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate tiago_simulation
   ```
## 🚀 Usage
1. Launch the Webots simulation
   ```bash
   webots worlds/kitchen.wbt
   ```
2. Webots Integration to use your Conda environment in Webots:
   1. Open Webots
   2. Go to **Tools → Preferences**
   3. Set **Python command** to the full path of the Conda Python:

   ```bash
   /home/your_username/miniconda3/envs/mobile_robots/bin/python
   ```
   
3. Click the "Play" button in Webots after launching

## 🧠 Behavior Architecture

The robot's behavior is structured as a hierarchical **Behavior Tree (BT)**, consisting of modules for mapping, perception, planning, navigation, and manipulation.

### 🔹 Root Node: `Main` (Sequence)

- **Check Map** (Selector):
  - `DoesMapExist`: Checks if a prior map is available
  - `Mapping`: The robot will follow the predefined trajectory to build the map of the environment
- **Pick-and-Place Cycles**:
  - Three repeated `PickAndPlace` sequences handle autonomous object manipulation

---

### 🔹 PickAndPlace (Sequence)

This subtree includes:

1. **Perception**
   - `Recognition`: detects jars
   - `ObjectSelector`: chooses one of the detected jars

2. **Approach and Pick**
   - `SetWaypoint`: sets a goal to approach the detected jar
   - `StraightLineNavigation`: executes a safe approach to the jar
   - `Manipulation (reach, closeGripper)`

3. **Placement**
   - `Planning + Navigation`: multi-step path to the table
   - `Manipulation (put, openGripper, safe)`

4. **Return**
   - `Planning + Navigation`: multi-step path back to worktop
   
> **Note:** The multi-step navigation to and from the table is necessary due to the robot's kinematic constraints. The TIAGo base cannot execute tight turning angles directly, so the path is divided into smaller segments to ensure feasible execution.

### 🧩 Behavior Tree Modules by Function

| Functionality      | Nodes Used                                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mapping**        | `DoesMapExist`, `Mapping`, `Navigation`                 |
| **Perception**     | `Recognition`, `ObjectSelector`                         |
| **Waypoint Planning** | `SetWaypoint`                                        |
| **Navigation**     | `Planning`, `Navigation`, `StraightLineNavigation`      |
| **Manipulation**   | `Manipulation (reach, grip, put, safe,...)`    |

> Behavior logic is fully implemented using `py_trees`, and each Pick-and-Place cycle is built using `create_pick_place_sequence(...)`.
